# emotional_awareness
You can be aware of your feelings quickly to use the “emotional_awareness”.
It is like a super simple app that records your emotions.
We are often asked someone ‘how are you?’, and almost people say ‘I’m good or fine’.
However, Does it really mean?
You can choose your real feelings through this npm, and it gives you a word that is written by English or Japanese according to your emotions.
I chose those words for me, so those may not suit you. Although I hope you enjoy it👋
