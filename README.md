# emotional_awareness
You can be aware of your feelings quickly to use the “emotional_awareness”.<br>
It is like a super simple app that records your emotions.<br>
We are often asked someone ‘how are you?’, and almost people say ‘I’m good or fine’.<br>
However, Does it really mean?<br>
You can choose your real feelings through this npm, and it gives you a word that is written by English or Japanese according to your emotions.<br>
I chose those words for me, so those may not suit you. Although I hope you enjoy it👋.<br>

# Install
